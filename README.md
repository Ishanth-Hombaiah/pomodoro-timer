# pomodoro-timer
This is a simple cmd prompt Pomodoro Timer script written in Python. This tool helps you boost productivity by breaking work into focused intervals (typically 25 minutes) followed by short breaks (typically 5 minutes), like the popular Pomodoro Technique. You can either start the timer immediately, or set it to start at the top of each 30 minute block (5:00PM, 5:30PM, etc).
